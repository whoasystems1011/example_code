## Whoa Excel Addin - Example Projects Repo
### Purpose
- This repo houses the **raw source code** for example projects built with **Whoa Excel Addin**
- The intention is to be a "quick reference" for code you saw during a YouTube video.
- No actual WB_HOST Workbook files are included.
- However, fake data import files (.csv) _are_ included; 
    - this way someone following a tutorial video could recreate the entire project (using the same raw data imported during the video).


### Demo Projects
#### Expense Classifier
- This project programatically calls out to ChatGPT for help classifying business expenses.
- **YouTube Playlist** where this project was built:
    - `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-dP8MhGTjIrCa2a5c42NozHgWvpcmftK`


#### Appraisal Demo
- This "mini project" covered most core functional aspects of the `Whoa Excel Addin`.
- It shows how `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` relations work (which the `ExpenseClassifier` project did not touch on at all.)
- **YouTube Video** where this project was built:
    - `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_3H0ig1iH8&ab_channel=WhoaSystems`


### Kindling Code
- These are standalone modules (not affiliated with any project)
- They are "kindling" to get started on specific things (like generating Google Earth .KML Map files)
